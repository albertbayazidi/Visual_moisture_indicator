# Visual moisture indicator with OLED screen

This code is used with a capacitive moisture sensor, arduino uno and a small OLED screen.
Remember to recalibrate your moisture sensor and to download the necessary libraries. This can be done in the arduino software or manually. Links can be found [Here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) for the adafruit_SSD1306.h and [Here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) for the adafruit_GFX.h


### Functionality
When the sensor detects a certain amount of water the screen will show a smiley face,
however if the sensor does not detect enough water it will show a frowny face.

### Usage
This can be used to let the user know if a plant is watered or not.
